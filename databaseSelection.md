## Why are you using MongoDB?
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format. It is widely used for applications requiring high scalability, flexibility, and rapid development.

### Strong Points of MongoDB
- Schema Flexibility: Unlike relational databases, MongoDB allows storing data in a flexible schema, making it ideal for handling dynamic and semi-structured data.
- Scalability: It supports horizontal scaling (sharding) to handle large datasets and high-traffic applications.
- High Performance: MongoDB offers fast read/write operations due to its document-based architecture.
- Built-in Replication & Failover: Provides built-in replication (Replica Sets) and automatic failover for better availability.
- Indexing Support: Supports various types of indexes to optimize query performance.
- JSON-like Data Format (BSON): Makes it easy to work with applications using JavaScript/Node.js.

### Weak Points of MongoDB
- No ACID Transactions (Pre-4.0 versions): Earlier versions lacked proper multi-document transactions, making it less suitable for applications requiring strong consistency.
- Memory Usage: Consumes more RAM as it keeps frequently accessed data in memory for fast operations.
- Complex Joins: Does not support traditional SQL-style joins efficiently, requiring data denormalization.
- Indexing Overhead: While indexing improves performance, excessive indexing can lead to higher storage requirements.
- Less Structured Data Relationships: Compared to relational databases, managing complex relationships can be more challenging.
